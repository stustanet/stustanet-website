## The StuStaNet Association
StuStaNet is an association that operates a computer network connecting the [Studentenstadt Freimann](https://stusta.de/en/) and the dormitory [Max-Bill-Stra√üe 67](https://max-bill.de/) to the Internet. The network is currently used by about {{% users %}} users.

StuStaNet offers its members additional services, such as a [outdoor Wi-Fi]({{< ref "wifi.en.md" >}}), private cloud storage, backup storage, webhosting and a mailbox with unlimited quota.

## History
{{< figure src="/figures/servers_2004.jpg" class="right" title="Our server room in 2004" >}}

Born as a student initiative, StuStaNet created its own network infrastructure in 1996 and operated it until 1999. In November 1999 StuStaNet replaced, jointly with the [Munich student union](https://www.studentenwerk-muenchen.de/), the aging network piece by piece in order to create a fully switched LAN. In 1997 it was linked up with the Munich scientific network operated by the [LRZ](https://www.lrz.de/).

Initially, the Internet connection was a simple 64kBit connection, later a 768kBit connection over SDSL, and since mid-1999 an optical fiber connection. This fiber connection initially operated with 10 MBit/s. In December 2000 this was upgraded to 100 MBit/s, in July 2007 to 1 GBit/s, in December 2012 to 2 GBit/s, in June 2017 to 4 GBit/s, and since October 2018 a 6 GBit/s connection.

The dormitory in the Max-Bill street was integrated into the StuStaNet Network in June 2016. It is separately connected to the Internet with 1 GBit/s.

It is a place for every nerd (not only network admins), who want to meet and talk about problems, exchange information or just do nerd stuff.
Every first Thursday in a month the [Administrator Council](https://wiki.stusta.de/Adminrat) takes place in the Hackerspace.
During the council administrators debate about the future of the network inside the StuSta.
