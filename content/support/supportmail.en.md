## Problem
You have a problem with your Internet connection and the instructions on the support pages didn't help to solve the problem.

## Solution
The first address for support with your Internet problems are the network admins in your house.

They were elected to help and support the residents with these types of problems. You don't have to be a member of the StuStaNet to get support from us.

Problems with your PC or Internet connection can often be solved much faster in-person. You should first ask a network administrator for help before writing a support mail.

A list of current network admins can be found here:

<a class="button" href="https://dokumente.stustanet.de/adminliste/adminliste.pdf">List of Networkadmins</a>

(only accessible from within the StuStaNet for privacy reasons). This list should also be posted in your house.

If the problem persists, please send an email to the support mailinglist.
