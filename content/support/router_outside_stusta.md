Hints to use the StuStaNet wifi router outside the Stusta

The routers from StuStaNet are designed that they can be easily
configured within Studentenstadt. However, it is also possible to use
them outside of the Studentenstadt. Some modifications are necessary.
Please notice that StuStaNet is primary for helping the residents. If
you need help to configure your router in your new dorm, please ask one
of the network administrators there. Please also keep in mind that the
following manual is just a general description and configuration can
vary, depending on your new location.

Steps to configure your router

1.  Connect to your router (by cable or by wifi).

2.  Open a browser and type in 192.168.1.1 (if that doesn't work, try
    192.168.2.1 or tplinkwifi.net).

3.  Now you should see a login page. The password is at the back of the
    router. Please notice that StuStaNet doesn't have any backups of the
    password.

6.  Now you can see in the „General Setup" window the data from your
    last room in Studentenstadt. It is possible to change it. After
    reconfiguration save the new settings.

Additional information: The software on the router is customized by
StuStaNet. It is possible to flash the original software. For this you
have to download the image from the internet, depending on your model
type, and flash it. Please notice that wrong flashing could lead to a
bricked router. Please just do this, if you know what you do. The
StuStaNet doesn't offer the service to flash routers.
