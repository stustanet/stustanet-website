# StuStaNet e.V.

## The StuStaNet Association
The StuStaNet is an association in the [Studentenstadt Freimann](https://stusta.de/en/) that operates a computer network connecting the Studentenstadt and the dormitory [Max-Bill-Stra√üe 67](https://max-bill.de/) to the Internet. The network is used by approximately 2,700 users.

In 1996, StuStaNet created its own network infrastructure and operated it until 1999. In November 1999, StuStaNet replaced, jointly with the [Munich student union](https://www.studentenwerk-muenchen.de/), the aging network piece by piece in order to create a fully switched LAN. In 1997, it was linked up with the Munich scientific network run by [LRZ](https://www.lrz.de/).

Initially, the Internet connection was a simple 64kBit connection, later a 768kBit connection over SDSL, and since mid-1999 an optical fiber connection. This fiber connection initially operated with 10 MBit/s. In December 2000 this was upgraded to 100 MBit/s, in July 2007 to 1 GBit/s, in December 2012 to a 2 GBit/s, and since June 2017 a 4 GBit/s connection.

StuStaNet operates all higher-level services such as DNS, email, HTTP Proxy, NAT, IPv6, QoS, IDS, and many more. In co-operation with the student union it provides all residents of Studentenstadt with Internet access and also provides support for the residents regarding network issues. StuStaNet offers its members additional services, such as a private cloud storage, backup storage, web space with a database and a mailbox with unlimited quota.

## Participation
If you want to do more than just surf the Internet the StuStaNet provides you the possibility of actively participating in the computer network, whether you want to administer one of the many servers we have, be a house administrator or even be part of the board of directors. Everyone interested in participating is welcome to join us at the monthly administrators' meeting.

## Membership
Residents of the Studentenstadt Freimann who would like to join the association must fill out a membership application form, which they can obtain within our office hours in the 'Blue House'.

Our office hours are posted in every house on the notice board.
